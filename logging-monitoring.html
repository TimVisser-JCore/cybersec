      <h3>Mitigates against</h3>
<ul>
<li>Identification and authentication failures</li>
<li>Software and data integrity failures</li>
<li>Security logging and monitoring failures</li>
<li>Server-side request forgery (SSRF)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the dynamic realm of software development, where the heartbeat of applications echoes through lines of code, the sentinel duo of logging and monitoring emerges as the vigilant guardians of security. This symphony, conducted by individual developers and development teams, orchestrates a harmonious defense against potential threats. Let's delve into the nuanced melody of logging and monitoring, resonating with the tone we've established earlier.</p>
<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>In order to implement good logging and monitoring, tooling is of the utmost importance. For logging purposes, good options are e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, in addition to logging, monitoring and alerting are of vital importance if you intend to act proactively based on the information you're collecting, and not just in hindsight. As such, some good starting points are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana">Kibana</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Usage of these tools is highly situational. As such, some research regarding the individual pros and cons is advised in order to make sure your team's needs are covered appropriately.</p>
<h2>Comprehensive Logging</h2>
<p>Every action within an application tells a story, and comprehensive logging is the narrative that unveils it. Developers, embrace detailed logging practices, capturing crucial events, errors, and user interactions. A well-crafted log not only aids in debugging but becomes a beacon in the dark when security incidents cast their shadows.</p>
<h2>Proactive Monitoring Systems</h2>
<p>Vigilance is not a passive state; it's an active pursuit. Implement proactive monitoring systems that cast a watchful eye on the application's health and security. From system performance metrics to user authentication patterns, monitoring provides early warnings, enabling swift responses to potential threats.</p>
<h2>Detecting Anomalies and Intrusions</h2>
<p>Anomalies in the melody often indicate potential disruptions, and the same principle applies to security. Monitoring systems equipped with anomaly detection algorithms become the virtuosos that detect irregularities, signaling the intrusion attempts that might otherwise go unnoticed.</p>
<h2>Real-Time Incident Response</h2>
<p>In the grand performance of security, timing is everything. Real-time monitoring facilitates swift incident response. Developers, cultivate the ability to interpret the notes of logs and monitoring alerts promptly, orchestrating responses that mitigate threats before they crescendo into serious breaches.</p>
<h2>Integrating Logging into Development Pipelines</h2>
<p>As developers craft the symphony of code, integrate logging seamlessly into the development pipelines. This ensures that security considerations become an intrinsic part of the development process, harmonizing the creation of robust and secure applications from their very inception. A symphony is delicate, and so is the balance between signal and noise in logging and monitoring. Strive for clarity, filtering out irrelevant noise to focus on meaningful signals that truly contribute to the security narrative. Precision in logging and monitoring amplifies their impact.</p>
