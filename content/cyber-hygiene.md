Title: Cyber Hygiene
Date: 2024-02-08
Summary: Short summary of Cyber Hygiene

### Mitigates against
- Cryptographic failures
- Security misconfigurations 
- Injection 
- Vulnerable and outdated components 
- Broken access control 
- Security logging and monitoring failures

Just as we discard outdated tools at the gym, strategic decommissioning trims excess, eliminating obsolete elements and streamlining our codebase.

Effective dependency management and the intentional removal of outdated components are the dynamic duo of our cyber fitness. They not only shield our projects from vulnerabilities but also enhance their agility, making them resilient in the face of evolving cyber threats. It's a holistic approach to ensuring our digital creations stay fit, robust, and ready for whatever the coding gym throws at them.

## Vet Your Dependencies
Before incorporating external code into your project, conduct a thorough evaluation. Opt for well-maintained libraries with an active community, positive reviews, and a developer with a solid reputation.

## Regularly Update Dependencies
Stay proactive by checking for updates on your dependencies. Applying updates promptly ensures that your project is fortified against known vulnerabilities and benefits from improved stability.

## Use Package Managers
Employ package managers such as npm, pip, or Maven to streamline the installation, updating, and removal of dependencies. These tools provide a centralized and organized approach to dependency management.

## Keep a Lean Codebase
Minimize dependencies to only those essential for your project. A concise codebase reduces the potential attack surface, making your project less susceptible to exploits. Consider native code alternatives for non-crucial dependencies.

## Check for Security Advisories
Stay informed about potential vulnerabilities by subscribing to security mailing lists or utilizing tools like GitHub's security advisory features. Timely awareness enables you to address threats before they escalate.

## Audit Code for Vulnerabilities
Conduct regular code audits using tools like static code analyzers and security scanners. This step ensures the identification and resolution of potential vulnerabilities, contributing to an enhanced overall security posture.

## Utilize Managed Repositories
- Centralized Control: Managed repositories provide a centralized platform for hosting and managing dependencies. Nexus Cloud, for example, allows you to maintain strict control over the artifacts your project relies on, ensuring version consistency and security.
- Efficient Collaboration: These repositories facilitate efficient collaboration by offering a shared space where team members can access, contribute to, and synchronize dependencies. This collaborative environment promotes consistency across development environments.
- Caching for Efficiency: Managed repositories often employ caching mechanisms, reducing the need to repeatedly download dependencies from external sources. This not only enhances build efficiency but also ensures a more stable and reliable development process.
- Proxying External Repositories: Nexus Cloud and similar tools can act as proxies for external repositories, mitigating the risks associated with relying directly on external sources. This minimizes exposure to potential security threats while maintaining a seamless development experience.
- Access Control and Security Policies: Managed repositories enable the implementation of access controls and security policies. This ensures that only authorized individuals have access to specific dependencies, adding an extra layer of security to your development workflow.

In the intricate world of coding, cyber hygiene is our project's tailored wellness routine. Picture dependency management as selecting precise nutritional supplements for your digital diet. It involves meticulous updates and integrations, ensuring our codebase thrives on the latest and most secure external elements.
