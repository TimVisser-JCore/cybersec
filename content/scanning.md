Summary: Short summary about scanning

### Mitigates against
- Broken access control 
- Insecure design
- Vulnerable and outdated components 
- Security misconfigurations

In the symphony of software development, where the echoes of code reverberate through the digital landscape, scanning emerges as the vigilant sentry, surveying the horizon for potential vulnerabilities and threats. This overture, led by individual developers and development teams, orchestrates a harmonious defense against the unseen dangers lurking within the codebase. Let's explore the nuanced melody of scanning, resonating with the established tone.

## Credential Scanning

Credentials are the keys to the digital kingdom, and their security is paramount. Developers, embrace credential scanning practices to detect exposed or compromised credentials. Leverage tools that scour the dark corners of the web, ensuring that the keys to your digital fortress remain firmly in your grasp.

## Vulnerability Scanning

Every line of code holds the potential for vulnerabilities. Integrate vulnerability scanning tools into the development pipeline to systematically identify and address weaknesses. Regular scans unveil the vulnerabilities that might be exploited by malicious actors, fortifying the application against potential breaches.

## Dependency Scanning

The software ecosystem is a tapestry woven with dependencies, each thread carrying its own risks. Employ dependency scanning tools to scrutinize libraries, frameworks, and third-party components for known vulnerabilities. This practice ensures that every strand in the digital tapestry is resilient, guarding against the vulnerabilities that may reside in the shadows.

## Code Quality Scanning

The quality of code is the cornerstone of robust applications. Embrace code quality scanning tools that assess adherence to coding standards, identify potential bugs, and enforce best practices. A well-orchestrated code quality scan ensures that the composition of your digital symphony remains elegant and error-free.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Scanning

As the development journey unfolds, integrate scanning seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines. This not only ensures that security considerations are ingrained in the development process but also enables the swift identification and remediation of issues at each stage, from code creation to deployment.

## Compliance Scanning

The regulatory landscape adds another layer of complexity to the composition. Conduct compliance scanning to ensure that your software adheres to industry and regulatory standards. This proactive approach not only averts potential legal pitfalls but also elevates the trustworthiness of your digital masterpiece.

## Regular Audits for Resilience

A symphony evolves through practice and refinement, and the same holds for software development. Regularly audit scanning results to refine security postures, address emerging threats, and ensure that the protective measures remain in harmony with the evolving threat landscape.

In the grand overture of software development, where each line of code contributes to the composition, scanning emerges as the vigilant conductor, harmonizing the defense against potential vulnerabilities and threats. Developers, heed the melodies of scanning with precision, for it is in the orchestrated interplay of scans that the security of digital landscapes finds its strength and resilience.
