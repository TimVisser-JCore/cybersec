Summary: This page will guide you on your journey through the cybersecurity handbook

This site can be considered a living document that acts as a transparent and actionable reference guide. It is intended to be a starting point for development teams working on an autonomous shift-left movement within the scope of their team's responsibilities.

We believe that development teams can and should feel empowered to put security first in their development practices. However, it can be complicated to define a starting point, let alone identify where to go from there. This guide intends to assist with this, such that good intentions can be translated into tangible improvements.

For your convenience, the below infographic showcases the headline topics we discuss in the guide:
